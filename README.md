# Automated-Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
In this face recognition  project, a computer system will be able to find and  recognize users masked face precisely in images or videos  that are being captured through a surveillance camera.

In real-world scenarios, human faces might be occluded by other 
objects such as facial mask. This makes the face recognition 
process a very challenging task. Consequently, current face 
recognition methods will easily fail to make an efficient 
recognition. The proposed method improves the generalization of 
face recognition process in the presence of the mask.The 
anticipated outcome of this project is the identification of masked 
face of students and mark their attendance automatically
